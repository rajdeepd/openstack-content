		<para>We have built a basic architecture for advanced testing
                purpose. This kind of architecture is close to the
                production, without High Availability (HA) and some
                services such as those for running OpenStack Object
                Storage. You can of course add as many compute nodes
                as you want. If you need more specific help, please
                read the official documentation of each project or
                write a post to an OpenStack mailing list.</para>
